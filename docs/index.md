# Jupyter Releases

This page contains all releases from Jupyter organizations in the last year. Click the organization to the left to see the list of latest posts.

::::{margin} This only tracks projects that use GitHub releases
:::{note} How does this work?
:class: dropdown
This uses the [excellent `Listings` plugin for MyST from Ryan Lovett](https://github.com/ryanlovett/myst-listing-plugin) to scrape GitHub for all releases across the Jupyter ecosystem and display them in a list.
:::
Some Jupyter organizations don't use GitHub releases, and this will totally ignore those projects! An example is [jupyterhub](https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyterhub).
